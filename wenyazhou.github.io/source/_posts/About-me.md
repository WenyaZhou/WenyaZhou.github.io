I was born in 1999. I'm hunting talents for a living. 

My favorite words: philosophy, sports, music, art, photograthy, smart, energetic, healthy, mathematics, writing, sleep, communication, reasoning, creation, debate, traveling. I am passionate about exploring complex things, enjoy unique ideas. I am curious about the unknown ðŸ¤”.

Keep moving forward.
