I was born in 1999. I'm hunting talents for a living. 

I am passionate about exploring complex things, enjoy unique ideas, and curious about the unknown ðŸ¤”. My favorite words: philosophy, sports, music, hardworking, art, photograthy, smart, energetic, healthy, mathematics, writing, sleep, communication, reasoning, creation, debate, traveling... 

> Death is perceived through reasoning, it is the movement of an instant; death belongs to the past or the future, not the present.

Life is like an adventure, with each step forward, collecting more clues to the meaning of being alive ðŸ˜¶. 

Keep moving forward.
